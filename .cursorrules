# Essential Rules for Flask/Python Work with Claude Code
# This file is automatically read by Claude Code in every conversation.
# For full details, see CLAUDE.md

## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

### 1. NEVER Delete the Database
- NEVER run `rm data/wallet.db` or delete database files
- Database contains all historical trading data, wallet configs, and encrypted credentials
- If corrupted, restore from backup first
- Exception: Only if explicitly requested by project owner AND verified backup exists

### 2. Always Backup Before Database Modifications
- BEFORE ANY database change: `cp data/wallet.db data/wallet_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db`
- Verify backup: `ls -lh data/wallet_backup_*.db`
- Store backups in `data/` directory on server
- Keep at least 2 recent backups
- Backup before: migrations, bulk operations, manual SQL, code changes affecting DB, encryption key changes

### 3. Always Create a Branch for Every Change
- ALWAYS create a branch before making ANY changes
- Branch off the CURRENT branch (not necessarily main): `git checkout -b feature/change-name` or `fix/bug-name`
- NEVER commit directly to any branch without creating a new branch first
- Workflow order: Code → Test → Document → Merge
- Exception: Only trivial changes (typos, formatting) with explicit approval from project owner

### 4. Test First, Document After, Then Merge
**CRITICAL WORKFLOW ORDER:**
1. **Code**: Make changes on branch
2. **Test**: Verify changes work completely (see Testing section)
3. **Document**: Only AFTER testing is confirmed, add documentation
4. **Merge**: Only merge after documentation is complete

**Documentation (AFTER testing confirmed):**
- Add docstrings to all new functions/classes
- Update `docs/GUIDE.md` for API/config changes
- Update `README.md` for user-facing features
- Document migrations with rollback steps
- Create session notes in `docs/session-notes/` for major changes
- Add gotchas to `CLAUDE.md` immediately

**Never merge until:**
- Testing is complete and verified
- Documentation is complete

## Database & Code Rules

### Database Migrations
- Create migration files with Claude, but ALWAYS review SQL before running
- Test on backup database first: `cp data/wallet.db data/wallet_backup_test.db`
- Use try/except for queries referencing new columns (handle missing column gracefully)
- Document migration order, dependencies, and rollback steps

### Database Sessions (SQLAlchemy)
- ALWAYS use context manager: `with get_session() as session:`
- NEVER reuse sessions across requests
- Commit explicitly: `session.commit()` after writes
- Rollback on errors: `session.rollback()` in exception handlers

### Background Threads
- Each thread needs its own database session
- Background threads don't have Flask request context
- Use Python logging, not Flask's `app.logger` in background threads
- Check `WERKZEUG_RUN_MAIN` to prevent double-starting in debug mode

## Code Quality Rules

### Testing
- ALWAYS verify changes work before claiming success
- Check: `ps aux | grep app.py`, `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
- Test actual routes, verify database writes, check logs
- Never assume changes worked without verification

### Logging
- Add `app.logger.info()` for complex flows
- Log: API calls, database queries, position calculations, strategy resolution
- Use format: `app.logger.info(f"Action: {variable}={value}")`

### Scope
- Keep conversations focused on single components
- Good: "Add validation to wallet form"
- Bad: "Refactor the whole app"

### Feature Flags
- Use env vars for experimental features: `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE = os.getenv('EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE', 'false').lower() == 'true'`
- Allows instant rollback without code changes

## Platform Gotchas

### Flask/SQLAlchemy/SQLite
- SQLAlchemy scoped sessions: Use `with get_session() as session:` pattern
- SQLite locking: Multiple threads writing can cause "database is locked" errors
- Flask reloader: Background threads start twice in debug mode (use `WERKZEUG_RUN_MAIN` check)
- CSRF tokens: Must include `{{ csrf_token() }}` in all POST forms

### Symbol Normalization
- ALWAYS normalize symbols before DB operations: `normalize_symbol(symbol)`
- Normalize both sides before comparisons
- Store normalized symbols in database
- Display can show original format, but store normalized

### Position Calculations
- Reopened positions: Find most recent zero-size → non-zero transition
- Multiple positions opened simultaneously: Margin delta can't be attributed to single position
- No historical data: Can't calculate leverage for positions opened before tracking started
- Always log calculation method used (`margin_delta`, `margin_rate`, `unknown`)

### Exchange APIs
- Add delays between rapid API calls: `time.sleep()`
- Cache responses, don't fetch same data multiple times per request
- Handle 429 (rate limit) errors gracefully
- Log all API calls to `logs/exchange_traffic.log`

### Encryption Keys
- NEVER change `ENCRYPTION_KEY` without re-encrypting all credentials
- Backup database before key changes
- Users will need to re-enter API keys if key changes

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Backup database (ALWAYS before changes)
cp data/wallet.db data/wallet_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db

# Check if app running
ps aux | grep app.py
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# View logs
tail -f logs/exchange_traffic.log

# Git workflow (ALWAYS create branch for every change)
# ORDER: Code → Test → Document → Merge

# 1. Create branch
git status  # Check current branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name  # Branch off current branch

# 2. Make code changes
# ... write code ...

# 3. TEST FIRST - Verify everything works
python app.py
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Test actual functionality, verify database writes, check logs

# 4. Commit code (after testing passes)
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description"

# 5. DOCUMENT AFTER TESTING CONFIRMED
# Add docstrings, update docs/GUIDE.md, README.md, etc.
git add .
git commit -m "docs: Add documentation for feature"

# 6. Merge ONLY after documentation complete
git checkout <parent-branch>
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Verify backup integrity
sqlite3 data/wallet_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

## Session Checklist

Before ending coding session (in order):
- [ ] Git branch created (ALWAYS required for any change)
- [ ] Database backed up (if any DB changes)
- [ ] Code changes made
- [ ] Changes tested and verified working (TEST FIRST)
- [ ] Code documented (docstrings, comments) - AFTER testing confirmed
- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md, GUIDE.md if needed) - AFTER testing confirmed
- [ ] Session notes created (for major changes) - AFTER testing confirmed
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated (if new gotcha discovered) - AFTER testing confirmed
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Branch merged to parent (ONLY after documentation complete)

---

**Remember**: Every session should leave the codebase better than it found it. Document gotchas, add logging, test thoroughly, backup before changes, and ALWAYS create a branch for every change.
